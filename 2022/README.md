# Advent of Code 2022

Internal challenges for the Advent of Code 2022: Use as many languages as possible, in the most readable manner as possible.

> NOTE: Productivity is not a goal, neither is performance or memory allocation. The goal is to have fun and learn new things.

> NOTE: The order of the languages is not important, but the list is. The list contains the languages I know, and the ones I want to learn.

> NOTE :Just for fun, I will use alternative languages beyond the one chosen for the day. For example, if I choose to use JavaScript for day 1, I will also try to solve the problem in C#, F# and Python, for comparison.
